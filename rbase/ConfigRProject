#Configuring R Studio Projects

Typically, there are several directories created in the root of the R project to partition the necessary files:
* R - files with function definitions, nothing that runs, only function defs
* data - stores all data files - these are not stored in github and contain all data used in analysis. It is read-only. Clean up is in the scripts
* doc - the analysis writeup
* figs - the generated files with figures, these should be automatically recreated by the scripts
* output - sim output, processed datasets (cleaned up), logs, or other WIPs
* scripts - these are in the root directory

R Hidden Directories - the rdata is in github, the locking files and junk are excluded from github

Note: Always use sessionInfo() to list all related pkges and drop it into output
